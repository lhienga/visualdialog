Atmospheric instability occurs when there is a large temperature difference between the surface and the upper levels of the atmosphere. This creates an environment that can lead to thunderstorms, which are characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning strikes.

Moisture plays a crucial role in the formation of thunderstorms. When warm, moist air from the ground rises into the upper levels of the atmosphere, it cools and sinks back down, creating an area of low pressure. This low-pressure area then attracts more moist air from the surrounding areas, leading to further convection (upward movement of air) and the formation of thunderstorms.

Strong winds are also a key component of thunderstorms. These winds can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h) and are often accompanied by heavy rain and lightning strikes. In some cases, strong winds can cause damage to buildings, trees, and other structures",2024-02-29 09:50:42.000000,30.43267774581909,like,1,"Storms are caused by a combination of factors, including atmospheric instability, moisture, and strong winds.

* Age: Typically between 25 and 45 years old
* Education: A bachelor's degree in engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics
* Experience: At least three years of related experience or a combination of education and experience
* Physical fitness: Astronauts must be in excellent physical condition and pass a series of physical exams
* Vision: 20/20 vision in each eye, with or without glasses or contact lenses
* Height: Between 62 and 76 inches (157.5 and 193 cm)
* Citizenship: United States citizenship is required for NASA astronauts, although some international space agencies may accept non-citizens as astronauts.
