The suits are equipped with various features, such as life support systems, communication equipment, and tools, to ensure their safety and comfort during their mission. The suits also provide a visual indication of the astronauts' identities, as they wear different patches on their helmets. One of the astronauts is closer to the front of the spacecraft, while the other is positioned further back. This suggests that they may be working in different parts of the spacecraft or performing different tasks. The presence of other objects within the spacecraft, such as chairs, computer monitors, and hand-held devices, indicates that the astronauts have access to various tools and resources to complete their work.

Atmospheric instability occurs when there is a large temperature difference between the surface and the upper levels of the atmosphere. This creates an environment that can lead to thunderstorms, which are characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning strikes.

Moisture plays a crucial role in the formation of thunderstorms. When warm, moist air from the ground rises into the upper levels of the atmosphere, it cools and sinks back down, creating an area of low pressure. This low-pressure area then attracts more moist air from the surrounding areas, leading to further convection (upward movement of air) and the formation of thunderstorms.

Strong winds are also a key component of thunderstorms. These winds can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h) and are often accompanied by heavy rain and lightning strikes. In some cases, strong winds can cause damage to buildings, trees, and other structures","Storms are caused by a combination of factors, including atmospheric instability, moisture, and strong winds.

3. Watering: Tulips require consistent moisture during their growing season. However, over-watering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to ensure proper drainage and not to waterlog the soil.

4. Fertilization: A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) can be used to provide essential nutrients to the tulip bulbs.
