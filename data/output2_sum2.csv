Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The accuracy of these predictions or decisions depends on the quality of the training data, the complexity of the model, and the choice of algorithms used.","In machine learning, the goal is to develop algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
