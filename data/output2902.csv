The suits are equipped with various features, such as life support systems, communication equipment, and tools, to ensure their safety and comfort during their mission. The suits also provide a visual indication of the astronauts' identities, as they wear different patches on their helmets. One of the astronauts is closer to the front of the spacecraft, while the other is positioned further back. This suggests that they may be working in different parts of the spacecraft or performing different tasks. The presence of other objects within the spacecraft, such as chairs, computer monitors, and hand-held devices, indicates that the astronauts have access to various tools and resources to complete their work.
