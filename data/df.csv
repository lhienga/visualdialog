Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. In other words, machine learning enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so. The applications of machine learning are vast and diverse, ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and autonomous vehicles. Some of the most common use cases of machine learning include:

1. Image Recognition: Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize objects, faces, and patterns within images. This technology is used in various applications, such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, and medical image analysis.
2. Natural Language Processing: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze, understand, and generate human language. This technology is used in various applications, such as chatbots, voice assistants, and sentiment analysis.
3. Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions about future events or trends. This technology is used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
4. Autonomous Vehicles: What is the difference between AI and ML?",2,41,866
