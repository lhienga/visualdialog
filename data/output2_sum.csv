Here are some tips for maintaining a healthy and thriving tulip field:

1. Proper soil preparation: Tulips require well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Before planting, the soil should be amended with compost or other organic matter to improve its structure and fertility.

2. Planting: Tulips can be planted in the fall or early spring, depending on your location. The bulbs should be planted at a depth of 4-6 inches, with the pointy end facing upwards.

3. Watering: Tulips require consistent moisture during their growing season. However, over-watering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to ensure proper drainage and not to waterlog the soil.

4. Fertilization: A balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) can be used to provide essential nutrients to the tulip bulbs.
